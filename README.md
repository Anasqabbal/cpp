# The Goal of Module00
- ex00 : creat a simple program that takes input as a argument and print it to the user in uppercase format


## New thing based on C

<< >> : in C you can use them to shift bits and in c++ you can use them for shift bits left and right and also this << as insertion operator

## basic things to know in C
**name space**: Namespaces allows you to group entities like classes objects and functions under a 
name\
**classes** is an expanded concept of a data structure, instead of holding only the data, it can hold the both data and functions\
you can declare class using the keyword `class`
**object**: is an instantiation af a `class`.\
**member functions**: is operators and functions that are declared as members of a class, the body of member function is analysed after the class declaration. so you can use the data or member that is inside your class in your member function.
- member functions : they have access to data members and other member functions of the class
- you can invoke the member function using the dote operator after the name of your object.
- when a member function is defined with const. it  can be called on a constant object and will not modify the object.
**stdio streams**: is a c++ way of formating input and output to a variety of sources, including the console, files, and string buffer.



## ex00
the first exercice in this Module is about printing some output to the user in the console in different cases
- without paremeter
- with parameters
- parameters with spaces in the begin and the end and you should ignore them. 


bouth the cin and cout in c++ is objects which you can use them to get the input and also to print the output to the user.

\
  ```cout << "Hello User" << "\n";```
