# The Goal of Module00
- ex00 : creat a simple program that takes input as a argument and print it to the user in uppercase format


## New thing based on C

<< >> : in C you can use them to shift bits and in c++ you can use them for shift bits left and right and also this << as insertion operator

## ex00
### what you should now to solve this exercice
of cource you need to know how to implement a simple Makefile to compile this project. and small knowledje about the iostream library

### cout and cin 
**cin :** used in c++ to get input from the user\
**cout :** used to print a message to the user on the console

bouth the cin and cout in c++ is objects which you can use them to get the input and also to print the output to the user.


\
  ```cout << "Hello User" << "\n";```
